# NiceLogin

A sample login page template for Xojo Web  
This project is obviously directed towards beginners to Xojo Web and is a result of my own personal transition from absolute beginner to just-beginner :)

It also demostrates a solution to a common beginner's question: how do I show an image as page background?  
It does so by executing javascript code at page startup.

I hope the rest is pretty self-explanatory
